## Release notes for alpha-4.

 * Fix issue where identifiers suggestions from let statements would begin with an invalid double-$,
 * Properly recognize map/list access as an expression (it would previously show as a parsing error in certain cases),

## Release notes for alpha-3.

 * Improved alias support:

 * Adds support for union and record types in parameter definitions,

 * Improvements to live templates:
    * Automatically open completion suggestions for `{param}` and `{alias}` live templates,
    * Renamed the single line `{call}` and `{param}` triggers to scall and sparam to avoid
      colliding with most probable case which is to have open-close tags.


## Release notes for alpha-2.

   trigger quick documentation),
 * Adds support for union and record types in parameter definitions,
 * Adds support for alias declaration that omit the alias identifier `{alias my.namespace}`,
 * Adds support for identifiers that are part of identifier expressions. For example in
   `{print($foo.bar.baz)}`, the identifier `$foo` is correctly recognized and will be a reference
   to the site where itâ€™s declared,
 * Fixes parsing issues where `uri` was not allowed as parameter name,
 * Fixes NPE when desugaring aliases.
